A library for writing web application tests in javascript.

Provides a procedural interface for writing tests, so you don't have to
grok event based programming. Uses PhantomJS to provide a webkit-based
headless browser to run your tests against.

Synopsis
--------

    phantom.injectJs('testlib.js');
    var t = new Test('https://github.com');

    t.done();
